Main Entities

The AMQ model takes the approach of smaller, modular pieces that can be combinedd in more diverse and robust ways. It starts by dividing these tasks into distinct roles:

    - The exchange, which accepts messages from producers and routes them message queues.
    - The message queue, which stores messages and forwards them to consumer applications.

There is a clear interface between exchange and message queue, called a "binding", which we will come to later. AMQP provides runtime-programmable semantics, throuhg two main aspects:

    1. The ability at runtime via the protocol to create arbitrary exchange and message queue types (some are defined in the standard, but others can be added as server extensions).

    2. The ability at runtime via the protocol to wire exchanges and message queues together to create any required message-processing system.
