The AMQP protocol is a binary protocol with modern features:
it is 
- multi-channel
- negotiated
- asynchronous
- secure
- portable
- neutral
- efficient

AMQP is usefully split into two layers:
    Functional Layer:
        - Basic
        - Transactions
        - Exchanges
        - Message queues

    Transport Layer:
        - Framing
        - Content
        - Data representation
        - Error handling
        - Heart-beating
        - Channels
