A binding is the relationship between an exchange and a message queue that tells the exchange how to route messages. Bindings are constructed from commands from the client application (the one owning and using the message queue) to an exchange.

Typecial use cases:
    - shared queues
        default exchange & default binding supports this; publishers publish message with a routing key which is the message queue name.

    - reply queues
        temporary, with server-assigned names. They are also usually private, read by a single consumer. Apart from these particularities, reply queues use the smae matching criteria as standard queues, so we can also use default exchange.

    - Pub-Sub Subscription queues
        subscription refers to at least two different concepts: the set of criteria that match messages and the temporary queue that holds mathed messages.

        AMQP separates the work into bindings and message queues. (There is no AMQP entity called "subscription")

        - holds messages for a single consumer
        - collects messages from multiple sources, through a set of bindings that match topics, message fields, or content in different ways.

        The key difference between a subscription queue and a named or reply queue is that the subscription queue name is irrelevant for the purposes of routing, and routing is done on abstracted matching criteria rather than a 1-to-1 matching of the routing key field.
