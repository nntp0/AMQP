AMQP is a multi-channelled protocol. Channels provide a way to multiplex a heavyweight TCP/IP connection into severral light weight connections.

Channels are independent of each other nd can perform different functions simultaneously with other channels, the available bandwidth being shared between the concurrent activities.

It is expected and encouraged that multi-threaded client applications may often use a "channel-per-thread" model as a programming convenience. However, opening several connections  to one or mote AMQP servers from a single client is also entirely acceptable. The channel life-cycle is this:

    - The client opens a new channel (Open).
    - The server confirms that the new channel is ready (Open-Ok).

    - The client and server use the channel as desired.

    - One peer (client or server) closes the channel (Close).
    - The other peer hand-shakes the channel close (Close-Ok).
