Types of Exchange

    Each exchange type implements a specific routing algorithm.
    There are a number of standard exchange types, explained in the "Functional Specifications" chapter, but there are two that are particularly important:

        The direct exchange type, which routes on a routing key. The defualt exchange is a direct exchange.
        The topic exchnage type, which routes on a routing pattern.

Exchange Life-cycle

    Each AMQP server pre-creates a number of exchanges (instances). These exchanges exist when the server starts and cannot be destroyed. AMQP applications can also create their own exchanges.
    
    AMQP does not use a "create" method as such, it uses an assertive "declare" method which means, "create if not present, otherwise continue".

    It is plausible that applications will create exchanges for private use and destroy them when their work is finished. AMQP provides a method to destroy exchanges but in general applications do not do this.
