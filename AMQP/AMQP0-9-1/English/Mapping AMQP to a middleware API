We have designed AMQP to be mappable to a middleware API. This mapping has some intelligence but it is also mechanical.

The advantages of this are having learnt the AMQP semantics, developers will find the same semantics provide in whatever environment they use.

For example, here is a Queue.Declare method example:
    Queue.Declare
        queue = my.queue
        auto-delete = TRUE
        exclusive = FALSE
