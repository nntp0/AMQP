Message Queue stores messages in memory or disk, and delivers these in sequence to one or more consumer applications. 
Message Queues are message storage and distribution entities. Each message queue is entirely independent and is a reasonably clever object.

A Message Queue has various properties:
    - private / shared
    - durable / temporary
    - client-named / server-named

By selecting the desired properties we can use a message queue to implement conventional middleware entities such as:
    
    - A shared store-and-forward queue, which holds messages and distributes these between consumers on a round-robin basis. Store and forward queues are typically durable and shared between multiple consumers.

    - A private reply queue, which holds messages and forwards these to a single consumer. Reply queues are typically temporary, server-named, and private to one consumer.

    - A private subscription queue, which holds messages collected from various "subscribed" sources, and forwards these to a single consumer.

These are not formally defined in AMQP: they are examples of how message queues can be used.
