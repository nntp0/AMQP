The AMQP commands are grouped into classes. Each class covers a specific functional domain. Some classes are optional - each peer implements the classes it needs to support.

There are two distinct method dialogues:
    - Synchronous request-response
        in which one peer sends a request and the other peer sends a reply.
        Synchronous request and response methods are used for functionality that is not performance critical.

    - Asynchronous notification
        in which one peer sends a method but expects no reply.
        Asynchronous methods are used where performance is critical.

    To make method processing simple, we define distinct replies for each synchronous request. That is, no method is used as the reply for two different request. This menas that a peer, sending a synchronous request, can accept and process incoming methods until getting one of the valid synchronous replies.

    A method is formally defined as a synchronous request, a synchronous reply, or asynchronous. Lastly, each method is formally defined as being client-side (server to client), or server-side (client to server).
