Message Queue Properties

    When a client application creates a message queue, it can select some important properties:
        
        - name
            if left unspecified, the server chooses a name and provides this to the client. Generally, when applications share a message queue they agree on a message queue name beforehand, and when an application needs a message queue for its own purposes, it lets the server provide a name.
        - exclusive
            if set, the queue belongs to the current connection only, and is deleted when the connection closes.
        - durable
            if set, the message queue remains present and active when the server restarts. It may lose transient messages if the server restarts.
    
Queue Life-cycles

    - Durable message queues
        that are shared by many consumers and have an independent existence
        i.e. they will continue to exist and collect messages whether or not there are consumers to receive them.

    - Temporary message queues
        that are private to one consumer and are tied to that consumer. When the consumer disconnects, the message queue is deleted.

    - Shared message queues
        that are deleted when the last of many consumers disconnects.
