AMQP provides portability between systems. It therefore needs a way to represent business data that may be required to route and deliver the message in a portable way accessible from many programming languages.

Normally, this encoding is only used to add routing properties to the "encelope" of the message; the contents inside the envelope are transported untouched. Applications will likely use XML, JSON or similar encodings in their message content too, but this is entirely optional.
