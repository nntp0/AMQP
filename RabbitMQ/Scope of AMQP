To enable complete interoperability for messaging middleware requires that both networking protocol and the semantics of the server-side services are sufficiently specified.

AMQP, therefore, defines both the network protocol and the server-side services through:
    - A defined set of messaging capabilities
        called the "Advanced Message Queuing Protocol Model"
        The AMQ model consists of a set of components that route and store messages within the broker service, plus a set of rules for wiriing these components together.
    - A network wire-level protocol, AMQP, that lets client applications talk to the server and interact with the AMQ model it implements.

    One can partially imply the semantics of the server from the AMQP protocol specifications but we believe that an explicit description of these semantics helps the understanding of the protocol.
